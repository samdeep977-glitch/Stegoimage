🧩 Stego Image Tool: Web Implementation of Secure Message Hiding Using LSB Method
🔍 Overview

Stego Image Tool is a fully browser-based steganography web application that allows users to hide and extract secret text messages inside images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.
Unlike traditional tools that require installations or server-side processing, this project is 100% client-side, built purely with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (Canvas API) — ensuring data privacy and cross-platform compatibility.
